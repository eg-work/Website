            So for the assignment I tried to create a financial based website. The page has 3 main pages - "World map", 
            "Market data" and "Sign up".
            The user can move to different sections by using the menu at the top of the site. This menu is loaded from
            the menu files inside "public/menu/". This folder includes the raw HTML, stylesheets for graphics and scripts
            for actually changing the content. The content is changed via submitting GET requests to the server where files
            are served statically - not from a database.
        </p>

        <h1>World map</h1>
        <p>
           Ok, so for the world map I wanted to be able to hover over different sections of the world and view financial
           information about that section. I choose to do this with an SVG as I want to get the experience. I took an image
           from Google of the world and I trace an outline using the drawing tools in Inkscape. I put each continent into
           a different group. I was hoping I could have perfect seemless mouse events with the SVG, rather then PNG files where
           the events may trigger on the rectangle box of the image rather then when crossing a continent background. Join up the 
           paths took a long time as when using the freehand tool Inkscape makes lots and lots of "little" paths. Originally I found 
           the image to be too slow and laggy, I feared the worst. I looked into optimising SVG images and saw how you can use the
           "simplify" tool to reduce the amounts of paths in the image. I then took each continent or island within a continet, basically
           I took all the shapes in the image and simplfied them individually. This took some time as I had to take care it wasn't over
           simplfied. I would zoom in and then use the tool, zoom out and check. I did this will all the paths. Once I had my simplfied image
           I learnt that you can save it as an "optimized svg". With this Inkscape will take off all the comments and other extra information 
           (extra information including Inkscape parameters, if the user would edit the image again with Inkscape). It also takes out redundated IDs.
           This improved the speed and now it works really well. 

           
           Next I imported it to the website as an object. This way I was able to access it's ".contentDocument" and get into the layers and groups I had
           set up in Inkscape. I set event listenings (in jQuery) to all the continent groups - ["North America", "South America", "Asia", "Africa", "Europe", "Austrailia"].
           Upon firing the events will simply change the fill color of all the paths making up a continent (include islands etc). This approach means
           the events never fire when the user's mouse is in the "sea", only when actually crossing an SVG path. This way creating tight boundaries.

        <h1>Market Data</h1>
        <p>
           I wanted to be able to show different market data sets to the user on demand. From different asset types (indices, forex, commodities etc).
           I ran out of time to finish everything but it still manages to pull the data from the server correctly. At the moment the user can simply 
           just select a different date set via submitting a choice for "Asset type", "Index name" and "Date". Indexname being the actual time series name,
           examples given are the China 300 index, the Germany 30 index, the FTSE 100 index and the Wall Street index.
        </p>


        <h1>Sign up</h1>
        <p>
            This section I wanted to try make a POST method work to the database. I set up a form with inputs and a submit button.
            This submission is handled in Javascript using jQuery to actually send the request. I managed to collect the data being 
            sent to the server side but I have yet to add in either a variable method on Index.js or another server in SQlite. 

            I also tried to add a bit more CSS styling to this part. I used different colors from Color.io for instance to create
            a more "eyesettling" view, which isn't as intrusive as the standard colors used on the web. 

            I also use a PNG file in this page. I managed to finally find some really good royalty free images. I made sure it had
            a high resolution and then set it to the background.
